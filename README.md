## Telegram Bot for ICO purpose

This is a special-purpose Bot for processing messages in Telegram Group/Super Group within ICO context.
The goal is to fight potential scammers by:

- Make it harder to get members' usernames in the group
- Ban any links (or blacklisted links) being posted on discussion group

The button below makes it super easy to get started by deploying on Heroku free dyno:

This initial codebase was written in a night, probably [CUI](http://brej.org/edit/influence/), so feel free to contribute and make this rudimentary Bot much better.

Let's **fight scammers together**!

- Whitelist users by username, these users can post anything.
- Do not allow new member to chat for *X minutes*.
- Detect any URL links, and ban users for *X minutes*.

- Store users on Firebase database when joined/left, as Telegram does not have this API to get data.

### Wishlist (help, please!)

- Auto PM new member with a template message.
- Auto post periodically.
- Improve error-handling.
- Unit tests LOL!

### Technical

- Deployed on Heroku

- HTTPS Webhook called by Telegram
- Auto set webhook by GET `/webhook` with proper host on browser

### File structure

All logics are contained within these files:

    app.rb
    config/helpers.rb

The rest are miscellaneous framework files necessary for running on Heroku.

### Setup local development environment

- Change values in `.env` file.
- Follow instructions in `config/firebase.json` to config link with Firebase.
- Start server with `ruby app.rb`.
- User local tunneling such as `ngrok` to create a public URL.
- Load `/webhook` in browser with public path (must be HTTPS).
